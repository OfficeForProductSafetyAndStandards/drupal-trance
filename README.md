INTRODUCTION
------------

Trance (TRANslatable Content Entity) contains abstract and base classes for 
defining a content entity type in its own module.

The content entity types are bundled, revisionable and translatable.

This approach significantly reduces the lines of code required to define a new
content entity type and reduces the amount of code duplication if more than 
one content entity type is defined.

An example module shows how to create a content entity type.
